3. Finally, you can run lavalink server, run bot, invite it to your server and test it.

To see the list of all available commands, enter next command: `!help` or `!?` (`!` is a default prefix, if you have provided another prefix in [appsettings.json](https://github.com/Masya1/FluffyMusic/blob/dev/FluffyMusic.ConsoleUI/appsettings.json), use it)
